<h2>
Working principle and mechanism 
</h2>
<body>
Automatic sanitizer dispenser is a device which works on the principle of IR sensor mechanism.<br>
 It consists of a proximity sensor board which will be emiting IR radiation,when an obstacle <br> 
 interferes, radiation reflects back and is sensed by the board and makes the OUT pin low,when<br>
 the OUT pin is low it starts up the PNP trasistor which in response starts up the submersible<br>
 DC pump.BD136 power trasistor is used here.When the obstacle is removed the OUT pin keeps high<br>
 and the pump remains off.

<h3>
Social importance 
</h3>

 To survive the global pandemic "covid-19" corona virus, wearing face mask,frequent sanitization<br>
 of hands and maintaining social distance has has became the weapons.<br>
 frequent sanitization by using alcohol based hand sanitizer helps in disinfection of hands <br>
 This "Automatic hand sanitizer dispenser" helps no contact sanitization unlike conventional <br>
 manual pumping sanitizers. Hence it also reduces the risk of infection.<br>
